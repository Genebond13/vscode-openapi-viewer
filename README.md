## What is Visual Studio Code OpenAPI viewer?

This extension allows developers and architects to view OpenAPI specifications visually, visually, and intuitively. It provides a preview of the specification in the form of an interactive document, which can be used to test and debug APIs. The preview can be accessed from within the Visual Studio editor, making it convenient for developers to view and edit the specification as they work on their code.

The extension is handy for developers and architects working on API-based projects, allowing them to see how their APIs will behave and interact with other components. It can also be used to generate documentation for APIs, which can be helpful for developers who are working on projects with multiple teams or sharing APIs with external clients.

The vscode-openapi-viewer extension is a valuable tool for developers and architects working with OpenAPI specifications. It provides a convenient and interactive way to preview, test, and debug APIs within Visual Studio.

## Getting started

1. First, open Visual Studio and go to the "Extensions" tab in the toolbar.
2. In the search bar, type "OpenAPI Preview" and press enter.
3. Click on the "OpenAPI Preview" extension in the search results and click "Download".
4. Once the extension has been downloaded, click "Install" to install it.
5. After the installation, you will need to restart Visual Studio for the changes to take effect.
6. Once Visual Studio has been restarted, you can open an OpenAPI specification file by going to "File > Open > File" and selecting the openapi specification file from your project.
7. The OpenAPI specification will be displayed in the Visual Studio editor. If the specification is valid, a preview button will appear. You can use this document to test and debug your APIs and generate documentation for them.

That's it! You should now be able to use the OpenAPI preview extension in Visual Studio to view and edit your OpenAPI specifications visually, visually, and intuitively.
